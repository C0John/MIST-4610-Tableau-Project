## Description of dataset:
Our dataset details all real estate sales in the state of Connecticut between Oct. 1st, 2001 and Sept. 30th, 2020 (using the "grand list year"). We obtained this dataset from [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset] as suggested. The dataset includes several columns of quantitative and qualitative data that can be used for data analysis and visualization using Tableau. The file includes the town, property address, date of sale, property type (residential, apartment, commercial, industrial or vacant land), sales price, and property assessment as columns. Each row in the table is an individual sale. These data points allow us to analyze trends related to time, location, and categorical attributes of each sale. 

## Question 1:
Which cities had the highest average real estate sale price? How did the average sale price change over time for each city?

- (insert importance here (social, economic, cultural, and other factors)
- (insert how this question is tied to the data set and being used)
- (insert graph/tableau results)
- (insert analysis and results: Analyze and visualize the results of your analysis and describe the implications of your analysis.
- Please provide any citations if required as well as supporting visualizations and analysis
generated from Tableau)

(Note: include how we're only showing cities above a certain amount for readability and relevance of data)

## Question 2:
What is the average sales ratio for each property type? What does the disparity between assessed value and actual sale amount indicate for certain property types?

- (insert importance here (social, economic, cultural, and other factors)
- (insert how this question is tied to the data set and being used)
- (insert graph/tableau results)
- (insert analysis and results: Analyze and visualize the results of your analysis and describe the implications of your analysis.
- Please provide any citations if required as well as supporting visualizations and analysis
generated from Tableau)

(Note: >1.0 sales ratio means actual sale was lower than assessed value)

(Note: I think 2nd graph shows same concept pretty much just using different columns.)

## Manipulations applied to the data set for analysis:
(Were there any manipulations or calculations that needed to be performed on the data, what
were they, describe the purpose and how they were accomplished)

## Tableau Packaged Workbook

Please see the Tableau Packaged Workbook below - the workbook was too large to upload to Github directly (file size limit 25MB).
